# Holidaze

Holidaze is a house rental website that utilizes a third-party API for managing accommodation bookings. It is a React-based project developed as the final project for Noroff school. The goal of this project is to showcase the candidate's development capabilities, visual design skills, and technical expertise.

## Project Brief

Holidaze is a newly launched accommodation booking site that requires a modern front-end application. The design and user experience have not been specified, but the official API documentation is provided for integration. The project involves two aspects: the customer-facing side of the website for booking holidays at venues, and an admin-facing side for venue and booking management.

This project focuses solely on the front-end application for the API, while the API functionality itself is managed by an existing application.
